# Integration with other libraries

## Overview

Our CSS engineers have been working hard to provide you with a minimalistic set of components and styles useful for your future dApps (you have to understand: they LOVE their raw CSS and creating everything from scratch). But - as they say- with great power comes great responsibility...

dAppBooster provides the **bare minimum** you need to create a dApp, no more, no less. But we understand that you may want to use other libraries to expand the functionality in your project, so in this guide we will show you how to integrate [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) with dAppBooster.

We consider Chakra UI to be a great choice for styling your dApps, as it provides a set of standard components and tools and it's also compatible with React's and Styled Components' philosophy.

## Let's get started

**Tip:** a complete demo with the results of this guide can be found in the https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/tree/ChakraUI fork of the dAppBooster repository.

First, you need to install Chakra UI in your project. You can do this by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/vite-guide).

Done? That's it! Now you can start using Chakra UI components in your dApps.

## A simple example

Let's go back to the example in the [Basic Styling](/docs/pages/styling/basic-styling.mdx) guide. Let's say we want to center the TokenInput component in the middle of [the page](https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/blob/ChakraUI/src/components/pageComponents/home/index.tsx) but this time using Chakra UI.

First, we remove all of Styled Component's code and use the the default TokenInput import:

```tsx
import TokenInput from '@/src/components/sharedComponents/TokenInput'
// the rest of the imports

export const Home = () => {
  // TokenInput's needed consts and values

  return (
      <TokenInput currentNetworkId={1} singleToken title="You pay" tokenInput={tokenInputSingle} />
  )
}
```

Now we can use Chakra UI's `Center` component to center the TokenInput:

```tsx
import { Center } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import TokenInput from '@/src/components/sharedComponents/TokenInput'
// the rest of the imports

export const Home = () => {
  // TokenInput's needed consts and values

  return (
    <Center width="100%">
      <TokenInput currentNetworkId={1} singleToken title="You pay" tokenInput={tokenInputSingle} />
    </Center>
  )
}
```

And that's it, the TokenInput component is now centered in the middle of the page withouth the need of any custom CSS!

You can also check the [Header](https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/blob/ChakraUI/src/components/sharedComponents/ui/Header.tsx) and [Footer](https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/blob/ChakraUI/src/components/sharedComponents/ui/Footer.tsx) files to see these components styled with pure Chakra UI.

:::info
**Remember:** there's no need to do this, but it's there if you need it. You can use 100% Chakra UI, 100% Styled Components, or a mix of both. It's up to you!

## But what about this or that styling library?

We understand you may prefer some other styling library, but there are dozens if not hundreds of them out there. We can't cover them all, nor guarantee they will work with dAppBooster. Here's a few links you might find useful:

# Integration with other libraries

## Overview

Our CSS engineers have been working hard to provide you with a minimalistic set of components and styles useful for your future dApps (you have to understand: they LOVE their raw CSS and creating everything from scratch). But - as they say- with great power comes great responsibility...

dAppBooster provides the **bare minimum** you need to create a dApp, no more, no less. But we understand that you may want to use other libraries to expand the functionality in your project, so in this guide we will show you how to integrate [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) with dAppBooster.

We consider Chakra UI to be a great choice for styling your dApps, as it provides a set of standard components and tools and it's also compatible with React's and Styled Components' philosophy.

## Let's get started

**Tip:** a complete demo with the results of this guide can be found in the https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/tree/ChakraUI fork of the dAppBooster repository.

First, you need to install Chakra UI in your project. You can do this by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/vite-guide).

Done? That's it! Now you can start using Chakra UI components in your dApps.

## A simple example

Let's go back to the example in the [Basic Styling](/docs/pages/styling/basic-styling.mdx) guide. Let's say we want to center the TokenInput component in the middle of [the page](https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/blob/ChakraUI/src/components/pageComponents/home/index.tsx) but this time using Chakra UI.

First, we remove all of Styled Component's code and use the the default TokenInput import:

```tsx
import TokenInput from '@/src/components/sharedComponents/TokenInput'
// the rest of the imports

export const Home = () => {
  // TokenInput's needed consts and values

  return (
      <TokenInput currentNetworkId={1} singleToken title="You pay" tokenInput={tokenInputSingle} />
  )
}
```

Now we can use Chakra UI's `Center` component to center the TokenInput:

```tsx
import { Center } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import TokenInput from '@/src/components/sharedComponents/TokenInput'
// the rest of the imports

export const Home = () => {
  // TokenInput's needed consts and values

  return (
    <Center width="100%">
      <TokenInput currentNetworkId={1} singleToken title="You pay" tokenInput={tokenInputSingle} />
    </Center>
  )
}
```

And that's it, the TokenInput component is now centered in the middle of the page withouth the need of any custom CSS!

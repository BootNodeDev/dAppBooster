# Integration with other libraries

## Overview

Our CSS engineers have been working hard to provide you with a minimalistic set of components and styles useful for your future dApps (you have to understand: they LOVE their raw CSS and creating everything from scratch). But - as they say- with great power comes great responsibility...

We understand that you may want to use other libraries in your project to save you some time, so in this guide we will show you how to integrate [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) with dAppBooster. We consider Chakra UI to be a great choice for styling your dApps, as it provides a set of standard components and tools and it's also compatible with React's and Styled Components' philosophy.

## Let's get started

**Tip:** a complete demo with the results of this guide can be found in the https://github.com/BootNodeDev/dAppBoosterBasicStyling/tree/ChakraUI fork of the dAppBooster repository.

First, you need to install Chakra UI in your project. You can do this by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/vite-guide).

Done? That's it! Now you can start using Chakra UI components in your dApps.

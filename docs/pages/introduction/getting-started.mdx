# Getting started [Getting started with dAppBooster in just a few lines of code.]

## Overview

dAppBooster is a starter-kit for boosting the development of decentralized applications (dApps).
It is build onto the last tools available such us [React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [viem](https://viem.sh/), [@tanstank-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [@tanstank-query](https://tanstack.com/router/latest), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

After more than five years of making decentralized apps, our team at [BootNode](https://bootnode.dev) has put together a simple yet powerful toolkit. This toolkit is designed to tackle the common hurdles and big decisions that come up when building dApps. It makes starting a new dApp smoother, cutting down on both time and complexity while focusing on developer experience, stability, bundle size, and performance. Here are some main features this starter-kit provides:

- **Structure:** a flexible structure to handle contracts, ABIS, subgraphs and common decentralized components.
- **Multi-chain:** native support and configuration to work with multiple chains with automatic type safe and super intuitive. 
- **Wallets connectivity:** native support to work with [connectkit](https://docs.family.co/connectkit), [rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/), [web3modal](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal).
- **Decentralized components:** Tree-shakable components that any dApp needs.
- **Subgraphs:** multi-chain subgraphs support with auto generated typed hooks to query data.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why dAppBooster](/introduction/why-dappBooster) section.

## Installation

Get a clean instance of the starter-kit by running

```bash [npx]
npx dappbooster dappBooster-firstDapp
```

Now, move to the project and install dependencies

```bash
cd dappBooster-firstDapp && pnpm i
```

Clone environment variables

```bash 
cp .env.example .env
```

Set wallet-connect project ID. You can get one in [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).

edit your `.env` by setting your wallet connect project id. 

```
# WalletConnect Project ID
PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=
```

Run the dApp in dev mode and open the link provided by this command in the browser. 

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

## Warming engines

We recommend starting with the [My first dApp guide](/guides/my-first-dapp) to see how easy it is to build a DApp with our starter kit. In just five minutes, this guide will show you how to create a DApp that lets you wrap and unwrap WETH on the Sepolia network. This hands-on introduction is an excellent first step to using dappBooster and getting familiar with its components.
